# Ember-repositories-prototype

OSF Repositories

This is just a sample starter app for prototyping OSF Repositories, an upcoming feature in the
Open Science Framework (https://osf.io).

On the OSF, you can organize your research and related materials into projects.
OSF Repositories will allow projects to be grouped by specific topics for easy discovery. 
For example, there could be a repository for breast cancer research, and every project in that 
repository would relate to this topic.  Users could submit their project to a repository, 
and search within and across repositories.

This feature is still in the planning stages. This starter app includes our OSF navbar/footer and
OSF styles.
